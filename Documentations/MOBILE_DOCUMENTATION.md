# Mobile documentation

*Our AREA mobile client is an Android application made in Kotlin*

### We built several pages for our mobile :

This page has a remember me option, a forgot password button, and you can choose to log in with a third party service (Google)

&emsp; **A register page ~** where a new user can create his account : username, email and password

You can also choose to register in our app with Google

&emsp; **A profile page ~** where the user can see his informations : profile picture, username, email…and can edit it

On this page you can also see the list of connected services and the workflow statistic
